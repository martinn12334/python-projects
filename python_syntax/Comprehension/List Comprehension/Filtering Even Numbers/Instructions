Filtering Even Numbers
In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to
filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.

First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers called numbers.

Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result.

This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
